Client application integrations allows a user to communicate with a Watson Assistant using spoken utterances, texting or other interaction.

The personal assistant applications created with Watson Assistant become personal when your users can access the service from where ever they want.  A smart speaker microphone, an app on a mobile device or messaging client application are examples of different types of client applications.  You can configure and use one of the Client Application Integrations IBM provides or you can create your own.

## Use an existing messaging client application
Messaging client applications typically allow the user to text a message to another address.  To use one of the existing messaging applications typically involves the following steps.

1.  Creating a user address for your personal assistant on the messaging service.
2.  Ensure the voice messages are going to your Watson Assistant Voice Service endpoint or text messages are going to the Assistant Builder service.
3.  Users simply start text or speak their questions or utterances to the client application and the Watson Assistant Builder responds.
