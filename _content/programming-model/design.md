## Personas and personality

### Personas
Applications that are created with specific users in mind focusing on their experience, pain points, and goals while the app are generally more successful.
Personas represent the collective information gathered about a specific user group. 
By identifying whether your persona is male or female, the age range, typical role, responsibilities, hobbies, etc you can evaluate all design and implementation decisions by considering they add value to your persona (customer).

### Personality
Personal assistants contain no user interface so the voice of the assistant is the user experience. To enhance the user experience for your customers, consider not just the gender of the PA, but its age, accent, the tone and speed at which it speaks.
Create a personality for the persona that provides a natural experience for customers.
