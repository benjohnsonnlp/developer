Programming models bridge the gap between the underlying hardware architecture, infrastructure services and developer services that form the underlying constructs needed to build applications. Programming models express how to build applications regardless of which programming languages is used. A programming model is easily explainable to a 10 year old.  It abstracts the underlying system algorithms, data structure and limitations while expressing the benefits of the system.

Imagine a personal assistant that could always be available to help regardless of where a person is or what device they are interacting with.  There are many digital assistant services available today however they are often limited in one or more of the following ways.

1.  Limited access from a specific set of devices. (A smart speaker and microphone.  A mobile phone.)
2.  Limited access using a specific type of interaction (texting or speech).
3.  Value add assistant services are not integrated with each one another.
4.  Don't provide flexibility in choosing underlying cognitive services.
5.  User must initiate the service using a wake up word rather than proactively be engaged by the assistant when needed.
6.  Digital assistants lack short term and long term memory and understanding for a specific user's context.

The Watson Assistant Builder programming model overcomes many of the above limitations building personal digital assistants.  The Watson Assistant Builder service provides single place to register value added digital assistant services for use by a business's customers.  These services are proactively triggered by Watson Assistant Builder service when a user interacts with devices, client applications and objects in around him or her.  Watson Assistant Builder is able to reason about the space around a person and decide when and which services could be useful.  The Watson Assistant Builder service allows developers to create applications that interact with customers in more human ways using IBM Watson cognitive services and others that you create using the Watson Assistant Builder service.
