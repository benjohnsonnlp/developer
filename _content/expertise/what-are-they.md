Expertise is an atomic reusable program for a single domain that allows a customer to experience or automate task or make a decision in a more intuitive proactive and personal way via user like voice, texting, presence or other gestures or response to a device like a sensor. Expertise are combined and used together within a Personal Assistant application to create an delightful user journey.  

Expertise use a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) engine to understand the what the user says(utterance) or types.   When an expertise is registered with the Personal Assistant it makes itself available to help the user with a task. The Personal Assistant Builder service determines the user's intent and routes the request to the appropriate expertise.  Requests often are more complex than a simple question and answer or command and control of a device.  For those types of requests the Personal Assistant Builder service engages in a dialog with the user to address all their intents.

The Watson Personal Assistant Builder uses the same natural language concepts as the Watson services. To learn more see the following references:

To get some ideas on the kinds of expertise that are available and you can build with the Watson Personal Assistant Builder review the [Git repository]().  This documentation also describes how to create [expertise]({{site.baseurl}}/developer/expertise/build-expertise/) if you don't find what you need in the [Expertise Github repository library]().

Expertise are accessed by the user using [client application integrations]({{site.baseurl}}/developer/cognitive-application/client-application-integrations/).
