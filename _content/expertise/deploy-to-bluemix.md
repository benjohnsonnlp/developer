This page will walk you through the next phase of building your first expertise.

1. [How to run and use the "HelloWorld" boilerplate expertise hosted locally.]({{site.baseurl}}/expertise/build-expertise)
2. [How to register and use the local running "HelloWorld" expertise with Personal Assistant Builder service.]({{site.baseurl}}/expertise/develop-locally)
3. **How to host your "HelloWorld" expertise on Bluemix for others to use.**

### Pre-requisite
In this phase you will use your own IBM Bluemix account.  Make sure you have completed all the Bluemix pre-requisites documented in the [setup your local development environment]({{site.baseurl}}/expertise/setup-local-dev-env/) page.

### Step 1: Stop the running expertise and ngrok processes
If your HelloWorldExpertise is still running, then control-c the process.  If you ran the "npm run start" command in the background, then find the node process and kill it.  You can use "lsof -i:10010" to easily find it. Also, if your ngrok process is still running, then control-c the process.

### Step 2: Edit manifest.yml file
In the directory for your HelloWorldExpertise, edit the `manifest.yml` file and change the `name` field to be something like "yourname-hello-world-expertise".

### Step 3: Push expertise to Bluemix
Push to Bluemix using Cloud Foundry command

`cf api https://api.stage1.ng.bluemix.net`

`cf login`

`cf push`

### Step 4: Make sure the expertise is running and reachable on Bluemix
Use the following curl command to hit the **/healthcheck** API on the expertise running on Bluemix.

`curl -X GET --verbose --header 'Accept: application/json' 'https://yourname-hello-world-expertise.mybluemix.net/v1/api/healthcheck'`

You should get a `200 OK` response if everything is working fine like the one below
```
> Connected to carloshelloexpertise.mybluemix.net (158.85.156.19) port 80 (#0)
> GET /v1/api/healthcheck HTTP/1.1
> Host: carloshelloexpertise.mybluemix.net
> User-Agent: curl/7.51.0
> Accept: application/json
>
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< X-Backside-Transport: OK OK
< Connection: Keep-Alive
< Transfer-Encoding: chunked

< Content-Type: application/json
< Date: Tue, 27 Jun 2017 01:05:06 GMT
< X-Powered-By: Express
< X-Global-Transaction-ID: 1919343303`
```

**Common errors**

```
curl: (6) Could not resolve host: Accept
```
* Check your URL to make sure it is the host name of the expertise running on Bluemix.
* Check to make sure you app / expertise is running on Bluemix.  Test the URL
* Check to make sure you application is running by opening a browser and trying to navigate to the Expertise Swagger doc. An example URL: https://carloshelloexpertise.mybluemix.net/docs/

### Step 5: Update the hostname for the expertise, running on Bluemix, to the Personal Assistant's collection
Use the Personal Assistant Builder service **/expertise/UpdateExpertise** API to update your expertise running on Bluemix to the public registry using your API Key and Personal Assistant Builder service Bluemix hosted URL.

**Make sure you change the `hostname` and paste your API key in the command below.**

`curl -X PUT --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{
  "name": "hello-world",
  "url": "https://yourname-hello-world-expertise.mybluemix.net"
}' 'https://watson-personal-assistant-toolkit.mybluemix.net/v1/api/expertise/UpdateExpertise/hello-world?api_key=paste-your-api-key-here'`

### Step 6: Say hello to your hello-world expertise hosted on Bluemix using the Personal Assistant Builder service
Use the Personal Assistant Builder service **/converse/expertiseCollection** API to say "Hello" using your API Key and Personal Assistant Builder service Bluemix hosted URL.

`curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{
  "id": "id-dc6",
  "version": "1.0",
  "language": "en-US",
  "text": "Hello",
  "context": {
    "user": {
      "id": "user-f4c"
    },
    "application": {
      "id": "application-14c",
      "attributes": {}
    }
  }
}' 'https://watson-personal-assistant-toolkit.mybluemix.net/v1/api/converse/expertiseCollection/example?api_key=paste-your-api-key-here'`

The JSON returned should include the following:

```
"speech": {
  "text": "Hello world"
},
```

Now that you have successfully created your first Hello World expertise you should try creating your own Expertise.  There are many example expertise developed and maintained by the Watson Assistant team that you can use to start from.  These can be found at [Expertise]({{site.baseurl}}/broken_link).  Other expertise can be found at [ConsumerIoT]({{site.baseurl}}/broken_link) then search repositories with `expertise` in the name.
