  Expertise at development time are shared via a GitHub repository.  Please share your  expertise with others in the table below. Expertise that are already deployed can also be shared using an endpoint URL.  Prior to using the endpoint you likely will have to register for the expertise and get an access or API key.

##  Types of expertise

  * **Community** - Created by one or more individual users that collaborate with one another to design, build and maintain expertise for their own personal or business use.  Licensing and support are usually best effort community based.   Some third parties may offer paid support for community developed expertise.
  * **Third party** - Created, licensed and supported a business or organization.  Usage may or may not require a subscription or purchase.   Often third party expertise require that you have procured your own license key and account to use the services required by the expertise.
  * **IBM** - Created, licensed and supported a IBM.  Usage and support may or may not require a subscription or purchase.
  * **User defined** - Created by an individual user for their own use and or use within their company.

  A goal in the future is to provide an developer console that includes an catalog of expertise that developers can publish their expertise to.   In the interim here is a list of known expertise and links to their Git repositories.
