Use these steps to quickly start powering your applications with an intelligent and proactive assistant:

* Firstly, [register]({{site.baseurl}}/get-started/get-api-key/) for the Watson Assistant Builder service.
* While you're waiting for your request to be approved, [understand]({{site.baseurl}}/understand-service/overview) the Watson Assistant Builder service.
* When your request is approved, you will receive an API key to access your personal assistant.
* If you want to use Bluemix or Watson services to power your application, you must request access to those services separately.
* Using your API key, [create a simple expertise]({{site.baseurl}}/expertise/what-are-they/) to learn how you go about giving your application intelligence.
* Lastly, [complete a _proactive_ tutorial]({{site.baseurl}}/knowledge/proactive/) to learn how to make your application proactive using the Knowledge and Reasoning service.
