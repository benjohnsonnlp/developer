### API key
An API key allows you access to the Watson Assistant Builder service.  An API key uniquely identifies the developer organization that is creating expertise or applications that use the Watson Assistant Builder service.  The key is also used for monitoring purposes. API keys should be stored in environment variables or env files and used when making API requests to the Assistant Builder service.  See example expertise implementations for how to use an API key.

Head to the [https://watson-personal-assistant-toolkit.mybluemix.net](https://watson-personal-assistant-toolkit.mybluemix.net) website and paste your key into the text field to then access your instance of the Watson Assistant Builder service. From there you can; access this documentation, access Swagger UIs for the various APIs and test your personal assistant with a simple text-based chat.

### Other service API keys
